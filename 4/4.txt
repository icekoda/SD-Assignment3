To begin for exercise one an advantage we saw is that it allows us to change
specific and different parts of the application without effecting or
changing the remaining parts of the application. This ability is crucial as a lot of
times within applications if you change one thing it requires you to change other
components for the program to run.So for exercise three using the observer pattern gives us
an advantage as it notifies the display/user when changes 
are being made but it would get a bit bothersome if there is a lot of changes 
happening due to the excessive amount of notifications.
All of these approaches had there unique advantages and disadvantages depending 
on what you are looking for within the application.
